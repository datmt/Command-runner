#COMMAND RUNNER
This app is simple, you can add a list of commands to run from shell and it will run for you. I created this for doing automatically test my wordpress plugin. I need to:
* Delete a folder in the test site
* copy new code to that folder using rsync or xcopy

## suggestions are welcome. Thanks!
